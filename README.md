- 👋 Hi, I’m @jashiranprueck
- 👀 I’m interested in doing projects that challenge and stimulate my brain! 
- 🌱 I’m currently majoring in information systems with a concentration in computer applications to have a solid foundation in a field i'm new to!
     I'm trying to diversify my resume and learn to apply my creativity to tech. 
- I am a behind-the-scenes kind of person and have passions for fashion and music. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the basics for now.
- I have no idea what i'm doing to be honest. All the help is welcomed!
